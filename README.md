# Repository for Data Science Workshop 2023L course - ATO Project

The main goal of the project is to **train and evaluate impostor detection systems**. 

The data is composed of aggregated **mouse and keyboard events**, belonging to different users. There are user identificators, but no impostor labels in the data.

### First meeting 02 march 2023 notes:

User sessions could be login sessions or other -- each exhibiting different characteristics even for the same user.

Project first objectives:

1) **analysis** of which features are useful for impostor detection purposes -- related with mouse or keyboard.

2) **evaluation** of chosen impostor detection systems, based on the paper provided by project manager.
